# Quaver-First-Place-Stats
A tool to measure how many first place scores a player has in Quaver.<br/>
Run the .exe or build from the source code and enter your (or another person's) Quaver player ID.

- Provides the total number of first places (because counting them on the website takes ages if you have 400 of them)
- Gives various highest/average/lowest stats (i.e. map length, difficulty, misscount, bpm, etc)
- Lists the most common charters/artists/map tags
- Shows overall MA/PA
- Shows your oldest first place
